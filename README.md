# Happy Vet

## Approach
* I used the FSA 'boilermaker' to start
  * [boilermaker](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker)
* Create the DB
* Define the Vet model
* Build out home page with view of all Vets

## Next Steps
* I would next try and let the user select a Vet or at least save as favorite or rate
* Maybe add a property to the Vet such as specialty that would allow for filtering
* I would try and style a bit more


## Installation
* Clone the repository
  * https://github.com/jonathanmchang/happyVet
* Navigate to the repository
* Install dependencies
  * npm install
* Create PosgtresSql database
  * createdb happyVet
* Run seed file
  * npm run seed
* Start server and run app
  * npm run start-dev
